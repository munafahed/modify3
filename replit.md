# Overview

This is a Next.js-based AI-powered app generation platform called "AppForge AI" (branded as "Genius APPio"). The platform allows users to generate complete Flutter applications by providing natural language prompts describing their desired app features, pages, and design. The system leverages Google's Gemini AI through Genkit to interpret user prompts and generate structured Flutter project files that can be downloaded as ZIP archives.

# Recent Updates

## September 26, 2025 - App Generation Bug Fix
- **Fixed Flutter Template Issues**: Resolved ReferenceError in flutter-template.ts caused by improper template literal escaping
  - Fixed Gradle build configuration template literals to prevent TypeScript interpolation
  - Corrected AndroidManifest.xml to properly handle app name substitution
  - Ensured proper Flutter Application class reference for Android builds
- **Environment Configuration**: Set up GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable for AI functionality

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.3 with TypeScript and React Server Components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library for consistent design
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessibility and customization
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and interactive elements
- **Theme Support**: Dark/light mode toggle with next-themes
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints

## Backend Architecture
- **AI Integration**: Google Genkit framework with Gemini 2.5 Flash model for prompt processing
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for user management
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router for file-based routing and API routes
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for local state management

## Core Features
- **AI App Generation**: Natural language to Flutter code conversion
- **Icon Generation**: AI-powered app icon creation based on app description
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Options for Firebase, Supabase, or custom Node.js backends
- **Real-time Progress**: Sidebar showing generation status and file structure
- **Bilingual Support**: Arabic and English with RTL/LTR layout support

## Design System
- **Color Scheme**: Olive green primary (#708238), light olive background (#E0E5D0), soft brown accent (#827038)
- **Typography**: PT Sans font family for both headlines and body text
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library for consistency
- **Particles**: Interactive particle background using tsParticles

## File Generation Flow
1. User submits natural language prompt describing desired app
2. System extracts app name and creates complete Flutter web project template including:
   - Web platform folder with index.html, manifest.json, and PWA icons
   - Project metadata and configuration files
   - Test structure and analysis configuration
3. Genkit processes prompt using Gemini AI model to generate:
   - Main application files (main.dart, app.dart)
   - Screen components and navigation
   - Models and services
   - Custom pubspec.yaml with dependencies
4. AI-generated files are merged with complete project template
5. Complete, runnable Flutter project is packaged and made available for download

### Template Files Generated
- **Web Platform**: index.html, manifest.json, PWA icons, web configuration
- **Project Root**: pubspec.yaml, .gitignore, .metadata, analysis_options.yaml
- **Application Code**: lib/main.dart with Material 3 architecture
- **Testing**: Basic widget tests and test configuration

Note: Projects are currently web-optimized. Android and iOS platform support will be added in future versions when Flutter SDK is available in the environment.
